          <p class = "design-descr">I see myself as a developer first and a designer second. But I see the two as intertwined and the principles that make for good code are in many ways similar to those that make for good design. The first principle of design I view as important is simplicity. Simple code is good code. Code should be self explanatory and easily readable. Elegant code should always be pursued over complex. Likewise in good design. At its core, design is a form of communication and as in any form of communication, a clear message is important. Design is much like an essay or a speech; a thesis or core message is essential. The rest of a design must clearly support the core message. Everything from color, to font, to arrangement of elements should evoke in the viewer a feeling which aligns with the core message. Anything else serves only to distract. For example, the thesis in the photography website above is simply to showcase the photographs. Every design choice was made with the photographs in mind. Specifically, I chose a minimalist aesthetic with little color or embellishing features, and a simple and symmetrical font so as to not draw the eye away from the images.</p>

          <p class = "design-descr">
          The second principle of design I view as important is collaboration. Design is deeply human - made by humans for humans. As such, it is important to incorporate the experience of many into design. Design is all about ideas, and to collaborate is to pool ideas. Collaboration is a form of elevation; a way to create something of greater quality than would be possible alone. Likewise in coding ,collaboration is extraordinarily valuable. In addition to the wealth of ideas that collaboration provides, it is a form of checks and balances. Collaboration is a rounding of rough edges and a more efficient path to a polished product. </p>

          <p class = "design-descr">The last principle of design I view as critically important is inspiration. Design is everywhere in the world and I believe in analyzing all design, good or bad. By looking around us we can find inspiration in design that works, and critique design that doesn't, thinking about how it could be improved. Similarly with coding, there is value in finding inspiration in solutions similar to the problem at hand. If a solution already exists, why reinvent the wheel? I frequently use libraries and resources like Stack Overflow so that the majority of my mental energy is focused on the particularities of the problem at hand. </p>

          <p class = "design-descr">Design without functionality is worthless. But functionality without design leaves something to be desired as well. The first step of good design is acknowledging its power. Think of Apple who recently reached a trillion dollar valuation. What sets Apple products apart? Yes, they have cool features and their internals are good, but neither is significantly superior to their competitors. What sets Apple products apart in my opinion is their branding and design. Itâ€™s the feel of the iPhone in the palm of the hand; the intuition of the trackpad and the pleasing geometry of the MacBooks. Principally, a product needs to work but why can't it be beautiful as well? </p>
